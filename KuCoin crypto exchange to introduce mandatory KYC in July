KuCoin’s Know Your Customer checks will require new users to complete identity verification to access all services, while existing non-KYC users will not be able to deposit.
Major cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin is working to strengthen its Know Your Customer (KYC) system by introducing new mandatory identity checks.
On June 28, KuCoin officially announced the upcoming KYC system upgrade in a move to increase compliance with global Anti-Money Laundering regulations.
The KYC authentication upgrade introduces mandatory KYC checks for all new users at KuCoin starting from July 15, 2023.
Without completing KYC, newly registered users will not be able to access KuCoin’s suite of products and services, the firm said.
Existing users who registered before July 15, 2023, will also have to complete the KYC process to access some features on KuCoin. 
Such users will not be able to deposit new funds, while withdrawals will remain unaffected, the announcement notes.
